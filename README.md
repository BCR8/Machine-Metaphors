# Machine-Metaphors
Python machine learning, strange human metaphors, ensuing hilarity.

Welcome to "Machine Metaphors", a machine learning project designed to churn out mixed metaphors based on a given dataset of idioms, phrases, jokes, and sayings. Some of the gems so far include:  
  
  * *Play the sack to dead*  
  * *A pie in the saddle is three in the fish*  
  * *Jest of the mouth*  
  * *A ship of the dam fish*  
  * *If we all stones them with femenists, soft*  

The link below will take you straight to a Google Colab notebook of the project. This is an in browser python sandbox where you can play around with settings, or even use your own dataset to do something similar!
